This is a WebGL-based VT220 emulator with a simple fallback for non-JS/non-WebGL/non-desktop
browsers. Made as a learning example and frontend for a cute text adventure game.

Also used as my home page on https://langworth.com/, hence the extra files.

This connects to an [ifhttp](https://github.com/statico/ifhttp) server which runs [the game](https://github.com/statico/the-archive-public).

Public domain.

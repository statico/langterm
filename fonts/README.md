These fonts are derived from the [Ultimate Apple II Font from KreativeKorp](https://www.kreativekorp.com/software/fonts/apple2.shtml) and are used with permission.

The WOFF2 font was generated using FontForge from PrintChar21.ttf. I had to change the OS/2 table type to "Automatic" and change the weight from 400 to 500 before exporting.
